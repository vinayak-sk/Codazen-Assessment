Part 1 Java:
	Student Class: 
		- Conatins constrtructer for first name, last name, age
		- method for returning string in the format of firstName+lastName+age

	Solution:
		- taking input as any 2 class
		- inserting students in classA in a HashMap with key as string -> firstName+lastName+age and values as student object
		- loop over classB and check if these student present in the HashMap i.e. in classA
		- if found incerase count by 1
		- return count

	Time Complexity: Big O(n), n being the size of class

	Space Complexity: Space required for storing elements in HashMap i.e. n -> size of classA

Part 2 JavaScript:
	Student Class: 
		- Conatins constrtructer for first name, last name, age
		- method for returning string in the format of firstName+lastName+age

	Solution:
		- Taking two classes as input to compare
		- create a diff array containg student object
		- compare objects in classA and classB
		- store dissimilar objects in diff array
		- subtract the size of larger class by diff array size
		- this will be the count of similar students in both classes

	Time Complexity: Big O(n)

	Space Complexity: Space required for storing diff array
